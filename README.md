# CS3012_SoftwareEngineeringReport
This report explores the ways in which the software engineering process can be assessed in terms of measurable data. It also provides an overview of the computational platforms available to perform this work, as well as some of the algorithmic approaches available. Finally, I describe some of the ethics concerns surrounding this kind of analytics.
